# 🖥 wESPdisplay
> **name of the library stands for "WiFi ESP display"**

the following folders are located in this repository:
- 📁 **esp32** with .ino file (you need to set WiFi name and password in it)
- 📁 **wespdisplay** with python library

📄 there is also a file **example.py** where is the example of using the library
## ✨ future
most likely, I will transfer the text scrolling functions and try to add the ability to send.bmp files, or other images
